# Cron Expression Generator

Create, understand, and manage cron expressions for scheduling tasks with an intuitive, developer-friendly interface.

## 🚀 Why Use Cron Expression Generator?

Scheduling tasks shouldn't require memorizing complex syntax. The **Cron Expression Generator** simplifies the process of creating crontab-compatible schedules, providing instant human-readable descriptions and full command formatting.

### Developer-Centric Features
- **Human-Readable Descriptions**: Instantly translates `*/15 9-17 * * 1-5` into "Runs every 15 minutes, between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM, on weekdays".
- **Full Cron Job Construction**: Combine your schedule with a specific command to generate a ready-to-use crontab line.
- **Common Presets**: Quick-start with standard schedules like "Every hour", "Midnight", or "Business hours".
- **Local History**: Automatically saves your last 20 generated expressions for quick retrieval.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Interactive Builder**: Select common intervals for minutes, hours, days, and months using simple dropdowns.
- **Manual Editing**: Directly edit the cron expression with real-time validation and description updates.
- **Execution Preview**: View upcoming execution times to visualize how your schedule will trigger.
- **Special Character Support**: Supports wildcards (`*`), ranges (`-`), increments (`/`), lists (`,`), and the last day of the month (`L`).
- **Privacy-First**: All processing and history storage happen entirely within your browser.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Build Your Schedule**: Use the dropdown menus for Minute, Hour, Day of Month, Month, and Day of Week to define your interval.
2. **Use Presets**: Click any of the "Common Presets" buttons to instantly load a standard schedule.
3. **Add a Command**: Enter the script or command you want to run in the "Command to run" field.
4. **Review Description**: Check the "Description" section to ensure the schedule matches your intent in plain English.
5. **Copy & Save**: Use the **Copy** button to grab the full cron job or **Save** to keep it in your local history.

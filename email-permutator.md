# Email Permutator

The **Email Permutator** is a specialized OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tool designed to generate common corporate email address formats based on a person's name and a target domain. It is an essential utility for security researchers, penetration testers, and sales professionals looking to identify potential contact points.

## 🚀 Why Use Email Permutator?

In professional environments, email addresses often follow predictable patterns. This tool automates the generation of these patterns, saving time and ensuring comprehensive coverage of common naming conventions.

# Biomedical Research Tool

The **Biomedical Research Tool** is a comprehensive platform designed for researchers, clinicians, and students to search, analyze, and synthesize biomedical data from multiple authoritative sources. It provides a unified interface to access scientific literature, clinical trials, and genomic information, enhanced by AI-powered analysis.

## Key Features

### 1. Scientific Literature Search
Access millions of research articles through the **PubTator** interface (integrating PubMed data).
- **Advanced Filtering**: Search by gene names, diseases, journal titles, authors, MeSH terms, and publication types.
- **Full-Text Access**: Retrieve abstracts and, where available, full-text content via PMC or direct scraping.
- **Article Summarization**: AI-generated summaries highlighting key findings, methods, results, and conclusions.

### 2. Clinical Trials Explorer
Search and monitor ongoing and completed clinical trials via the **ClinicalTrials.gov** API.
- **Detailed Parameters**: Filter by condition, intervention, trial status (e.g., Recruiting, Completed), phase (Phase 1-4), and geographic location.
- **Comprehensive Data**: View NCT IDs, study designs, eligibility criteria, primary/secondary outcomes, and contact information.

### 3. Genomic Variant Analysis
Investigate genetic variants and their clinical significance using the **MyVariant.info** database.
- **Precision Search**: Search by gene symbol, chromosome, dbSNP ID, and phenotype.
- **Clinical Insights**: Access clinical significance (e.g., Pathogenic, Benign), allele frequencies, and HGVS notations.
- **Literature Links**: Directly connect variants to relevant PubMed publications.

### 4. AI Research Assistant
Leverage advanced AI to accelerate your research workflow:
- **Result Analysis**: Synthesize patterns and key findings across multiple search results.
- **Query Optimization**: Improve search precision using suggested medical terminology and Boolean structures.
- **Research Generation**: Automatically generate focused research questions and related search terms.
- **Literature Review**: Create concise syntheses of retrieved articles to identify research gaps.

## How to Use

1.  **Select a Search Tab**: Choose between **Articles**, **Trials**, or **Variants** based on your research needs.
2.  **Enter Search Criteria**: Use the main search bar for general queries or expand the filters for precise targeting (e.g., specific genes or trial phases).
3.  **Analyze Results**: Browse the unified results list. Click on any item to view its dedicated details page.
4.  **Engage the AI Assistant**: Use the AI panel to summarize findings, ask questions about the data, or refine your search strategy.

# Focus Timer

Boost your productivity with a versatile timer featuring Stopwatch, Pomodoro, and Countdown modes. Designed for precision and ease of use, the Focus Timer helps you manage your time effectively, whether you're tracking tasks, following a study technique, or setting a simple reminder.

## 🚀 Why Use Focus Timer?

**Focus Timer** is a multi-functional utility built to cater to various time-management needs. Whether you need the high-resolution tracking of a stopwatch or the structured intervals of the Pomodoro technique, this tool provides a clean, distraction-free environment.

### Key Benefits
- **Three-in-One Utility**: Switch seamlessly between Stopwatch, Pomodoro, and Countdown modes.
- **Highly Customizable**: Tailor Pomodoro intervals and cycle counts to fit your personal workflow.
- **Precise Tracking**: Uses system-time calculations (`Date.now()`) to ensure accuracy and prevent timer drift.
- **Privacy-First**: All timing logic runs locally in your browser; no data is sent to any server.

## 🛠️ Key Features

### 1. Stopwatch Mode
- **High Precision**: Tracks time down to centiseconds (1/100th of a second).
- **Lap Timing**: Record multiple laps while the timer is running to track split times. Laps are displayed in a scrollable list.
- **Dynamic Display**: Automatically adjusts from `MM:SS.CS` to `HH:MM:SS.CS` for sessions exceeding one hour.

### 2. Pomodoro Mode
- **Structured Focus**: Cycles through **Work**, **Short Break**, and **Long Break** phases.
- **Manual Phase Control**: Each phase must be started manually after the previous one ends, allowing you to take a moment between intervals.
- **Custom Intervals**: Set your own durations (in minutes) for work and break periods.
- **Cycle Management**: Define how many work sessions to complete before taking a long break (default is 4).
- **Phase Skipping**: Quickly move to the next phase if you finish early or need to adjust.
- **Audio Alerts**: A notification sound plays at the end of each phase.

### 3. Countdown Mode
- **Flexible Input**: Set durations using HH, MM, and SS fields, supporting up to 99 hours, 59 minutes, and 59 seconds.
- **Pause & Resume**: Easily interrupt and continue your countdown without losing progress.
- **Completion Alert**: Plays a notification sound when the timer reaches zero.

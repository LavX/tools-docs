# HMAC Generator

Generate HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) using various hash algorithms and a secret key. This tool allows you to verify data integrity and authenticity using industry-standard cryptographic methods.

## 🚀 Why Use HMAC Generator?

In the realm of cybersecurity, **HMAC Generator** provides a critical service for professionals and enthusiasts alike. Whether you're performing a security audit, investigating a potential threat, or just curious about how things work under the hood, this tool offers the precision and reliability you need.

### Security First
- **Client-Side Processing**: Your sensitive data never leaves your browser. We use the Web Crypto API for all computations.
- **No Data Logging**: We don't store your inputs or results. Your privacy is our priority.
- **Open Standards**: Built using industry-standard algorithms (SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, and SHA-1 for legacy support).

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Multiple Algorithms**: Support for SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, and SHA-1 (Note: SHA-1 is provided for compatibility but is considered less secure).
- **Fast & Reliable**: Optimized for performance using native browser cryptographic APIs (Web Crypto API).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, distraction-free design focused on productivity.
- **Privacy-Focused**: All processing happens entirely in your browser.
- **Hex Output**: Generates a hexadecimal representation of the HMAC signature.
- **UTF-8 Support**: Inputs are processed using UTF-8 encoding.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Access the Tool**: Navigate to the [HMAC Generator](https://tools.lavx.hu/tools/hmac-generator) page.
2. **Input Your Data**: Enter the message or data you want to hash in the **Input Data** area (Required).
3. **Enter Secret Key**: Provide your cryptographic secret key in the **Secret Key** field (Required).
4. **Select Algorithm**: Choose the desired hash algorithm (SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, or SHA-1) from the dropdown menu.
5. **Get Results**: Click the **Generate HMAC** button to view your results instantly.
6. **Copy Result**: Use the **Copy HMAC** button to copy the hexadecimal output to your clipboard.

> **Tip**: The output is in Hexadecimal format. If you need to convert it to text or another format, you can use our [Encoder/Decoder tool](https://tools.lavx.hu/tools/encoder-decoder) and select the Hexadecimal decode option.

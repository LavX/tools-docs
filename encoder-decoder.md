# Encoder/Decoder

A comprehensive utility for encoding and decoding text across multiple formats, including standard web encodings and classic cryptographic ciphers.

## 🚀 Why Use Encoder/Decoder?

The **Encoder/Decoder** tool is a versatile utility designed for developers, security researchers, and anyone needing to transform text data. It provides a unified interface for common encoding tasks and simple encryption methods, all processed locally in your browser for maximum privacy.

### Key Benefits
- **Multi-Format Support**: Handle everything from Base64 to Morse code in one place.
- **Real-Time Results**: See transformations instantly as you type.
- **Privacy-First**: All processing happens client-side; your data never leaves your device.
- **History Tracking**: Quickly access your last 10 operations, saved locally for convenience.

## 🛠️ Key Features

### Supported Formats
- **Base64**: Standard binary-to-text encoding for data transfer.
- **URL**: Safe encoding for URI components.
- **HTML Entities**: Convert special characters to HTML-safe entities (includes a reference table).
- **Hexadecimal**: Transform text into its hex representation.
- **Binary**: Convert text to 8-bit binary sequences.
- **ASCII Codes**: View text as decimal ASCII values.
- **Morse Code**: Standard international Morse code translation.
- **ROT13**: A simple substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet.
- **Atbash Cipher**: A substitution cipher formed by reversing the alphabet.
- **Caesar Cipher**: A shift cipher with a configurable shift value (key).
- **XOR Cipher**: Bitwise XOR encryption using a custom secret key (input/output handled as Hex).

### Advanced Functionality
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjust Caesar shift values or set custom XOR keys.
- **Smart History**: Automatically saves recent operations with input/output previews.
- **One-Click Utilities**: Easily copy results, clear inputs, or swap output back to input for multi-stage encoding.
- **Reference Tools**: Built-in HTML entity reference table for quick lookups.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Select Encoding Type**: Choose your desired format from the grid of available options.
2. **Choose Mode**: Toggle between **Encode** and **Decode** modes.
3. **Input Text**: Type or paste your text into the input area. The tool processes data in real-time.
4. **Configure (Optional)**: For Caesar or XOR ciphers, enter the required shift value or secret key.
5. **Manage Results**:
   - Use **Copy** to grab the output.
   - Use **Use as Input** to perform further operations on the result.
   - Review **Recent Operations** to revisit previous work.

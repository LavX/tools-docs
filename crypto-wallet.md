# Crypto Wallet Generator

A deterministic cryptocurrency wallet address generator for educational and demonstration purposes.

## 🚀 Why Use Crypto Wallet Generator?

The **Crypto Wallet Generator** is a specialized utility designed to demonstrate how deterministic wallet addresses can be derived from a seed value. It provides a visual and interactive way to understand address formats across different blockchain networks.

### Key Benefits
- **Educational Insight**: Learn about address prefixes and formats for various popular blockchains.
- **Deterministic Generation**: Understand how the same seed consistently produces the same set of addresses.
- **Multi-Network Support**: Explore addresses for 10 different blockchain ecosystems in one place.
- **Privacy-Focused**: All address generation happens locally in your browser; your seed never leaves your device.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Seed-Based Generation**: Use a custom string or generate a random seed to derive addresses.
- **Wide Network Support**: Supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Solana, Cardano, Ripple, Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Tron.
- **Interactive Selection**: Easily toggle specific networks or select all at once.
- **One-Click Copy**: Quickly copy generated addresses to your clipboard.

1. **Access the Tool**: Navigate to the [Crypto Wallet Generator](https://tools.lavx.hu/tools/crypto-wallet) page.
2. **Set Your Seed**: Use the automatically generated random seed or enter your own custom string in the "Seed Value" input.
3. **Select Networks**: Choose the blockchains you are interested in by clicking on their cards. You can use "Select All" for a comprehensive view.
4. **Generate Addresses**: Click the "Generate Wallet Addresses" button to derive the addresses from your seed.
5. **Explore Results**: View the generated addresses, copy them to your clipboard, or click "Explorer" to see the address on a live blockchain explorer.

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimer

**This tool is for educational and demonstration purposes only.**

- **NOT SECURE**: The generation method is simplified and does not follow production-grade cryptographic standards (like BIP-32 or BIP-44).
- **NO PRIVATE KEYS**: This tool generates addresses based on a seed but does not provide valid private/public key pairs for real-world use.
- **DO NOT USE FOR TRANSACTIONS**: Never send real cryptocurrency to these addresses. You will lose your funds permanently.
- **DEMONSTRATION ONLY**: These addresses are deterministic based on the input seed but are not intended for actual financial use.

# Hash Identifier

Identify unknown hash strings instantly. This tool analyzes the format, length, and character set of a hash to determine the likely algorithm used to generate it, supporting MD5, SHA families, Bcrypt, and more.

## 🚀 Why Use Hash Identifier?

In cybersecurity and digital forensics, identifying the type of hash is the first step toward understanding how data was protected or identifying potential vulnerabilities. **Hash Identifier** provides a fast, client-side solution for security professionals and developers.

### Security & Privacy
- **100% Client-Side**: All identification logic runs in your browser. Your hash strings are never sent to our servers.
- **No Data Logging**: We do not store or track any inputs or results.
- **Instant Analysis**: Real-time detection as you type or paste.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Broad Algorithm Support**: Detects everything from legacy MD4/MD5 to modern SHA-3 and Bcrypt.
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides High, Medium, or Low confidence ratings based on the uniqueness of the hash format.
- **Format Detection**: Recognizes Hexadecimal, Base64, and specific Unix crypt formats (e.g., $1$, $5$, $6$).
- **Length Tracking**: Automatically displays the character count of the input string to aid manual analysis.
- **Clean Interface**: A focused, distraction-free environment for rapid analysis.

## 📋 Supported Algorithms

The tool can identify a wide range of algorithms, including:

- **MD Family**: MD4, MD5 (Hex & Base64), MD5-Crypt ($1$)
- **SHA Family**: SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512
- **SHA-3 Family**: SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512
- **Unix Crypt Formats**: MD5-Crypt ($1$), SHA-256 Crypt ($5$), SHA-512 Crypt ($6$)
- **Password Hashes**: Bcrypt ($2a$, $2b$, $2y$), NTLM, MySQL5
- **Specialized Hashes**: RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-160, Whirlpool, GOST

## 📖 How to Use

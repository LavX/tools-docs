# Water Temperature Calculator

Calculate the precise ratio and quantities of hot and cold water to achieve your target temperature using thermal equilibrium principles.

## 🚀 Why Use Water Temperature Calculator?

Perfect temperature control is essential for cooking, brewing, scientific experiments, and everyday tasks. The **Water Temperature Calculator** eliminates guesswork by providing exact measurements based on established thermal equilibrium physics.

### Precision & Reliability
- **Scientific Formula**: Uses the thermal equilibrium equation `m₁/m₂ = (T₃-T₂)/(T₁-T₃)`
- **Real-time Calculations**: Results update instantly as you adjust parameters
- **Visual Feedback**: Temperature visualization helps you understand the mixing process
- **Error Prevention**: Built-in validation prevents impossible temperature combinations

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Temperature-Based Mixing**: Calculate exact hot/cold water quantities needed
- **Input Validation**: Ensures hot water is hotter than target, cold water is colder than target
- **Volume Flexibility**: Works with any unit (ml, gallons, cups) - just be consistent
- **Visual Feedback**: Temperature visualization showing your mixing scenario
- **Formula Explanation**: Built-in explanation of the thermal equilibrium principle
- **Temperature Limits**: Operates within 0°C to 100°C range for safety and accuracy
- **Privacy-Focused**: All calculations performed locally in your browser

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Access the Tool**: Navigate to the [Water Temperature Calculator](https://tools.lavx.hu/tools/water-temp-calculator) page.
2. **Enter Temperatures**: Input your hot water temperature, cold water temperature, and desired target temperature
3. **Specify Volume**: Enter the total amount of water you need
4. **Get Instant Results**: View the exact quantities of hot and cold water to mix
5. **Visualize**: Use the temperature visualization to understand your mixing ratios

## 🔬 The Science Behind It

### Thermal Equilibrium Formula
The calculator uses the principle of thermal equilibrium where heat gained by cold water equals heat lost by hot water:

**Formula**: `m₁/m₂ = (T₃-T₂)/(T₁-T₃)`

Where:
- **T₁** = Hot water temperature
- **T₂** = Cold water temperature  
- **T₃** = Target temperature
- **m₁** = Hot water quantity
- **m₂** = Cold water quantity

### Practical Example
If you want to achieve 40°C water by mixing 93°C hot water with 22°C cold water, and you need a total of 180ml, the calculator will tell you to use approximately 45.7ml of hot water and 134.3ml of cold water.

## ⚠️ Important Constraints

- **Temperature Range**: All temperatures must be between 0°C and 100°C
- **Logical Relationships**: Hot water must be hotter than target, cold water must be colder than target
- **Minimum Values**: Total volume must be greater than 0
- **Unit Consistency**: Use consistent units for volume (all ml, or all gallons, etc.)

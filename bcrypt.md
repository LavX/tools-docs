# Bcrypt Tool

Generate and verify Bcrypt hashes for secure password management and security testing.

## 🚀 Why Use Bcrypt Tool?

The **Bcrypt Tool** is an essential utility for developers and security professionals. Bcrypt is a password-hashing function based on the Blowfish cipher, designed to be slow and computationally expensive to protect against brute-force and rainbow table attacks.

### Security & Privacy
- **Client-Side Execution**: All hashing and comparison logic runs entirely in your browser using `bcryptjs`. Your plain-text passwords never leave your machine.
- **No Data Logging**: We do not store, log, or transmit any of your inputs or generated hashes.
- **Adaptive Security**: Supports custom salt rounds to adjust the computational cost as needed.

## 🛠️ Key Features

### 1. Generate Bcrypt Hash
Create secure hashes from any input text with configurable complexity.
- **Text to Hash**: Enter the string you want to secure.
- **Salt Rounds**: Define the cost factor (default is 10). Higher values increase security but take longer to compute.
- **Instant Output**: Get your hash immediately with a one-click copy feature.

### 2. Compare Text with Bcrypt Hash
Verify if a plain-text string matches an existing Bcrypt hash.
- **Plain Text**: The original string you want to verify.
- **Hash to Compare**: The Bcrypt hash you are checking against.
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear "Match!" or "No Match." indicators based on the comparison result.

## 📖 How to Use

### Generating a Hash
1. Navigate to the [Bcrypt Tool](https://tools.lavx.hu/tools/bcrypt).
2. In the **Generate Bcrypt Hash** section, enter your text in the "Text to Hash" field.
3. (Optional) Adjust the **Salt Rounds** (default is 10).
4. Click **Generate Hash**.
5. Use the **Copy** button to save the resulting hash.

### Verifying a Hash
1. In the **Compare Text with Bcrypt Hash** section, enter the plain text.
2. Paste the Bcrypt hash into the "Hash to Compare Against" field.
3. Click **Compare**.
4. The tool will display whether the text matches the hash.

# IPv4 Range Expander

The **IPv4 Range Expander** is a specialized utility designed to convert CIDR notation or single IP addresses into a comprehensive list of individual IPv4 addresses. This tool is essential for network administrators, security researchers, and developers who need to visualize or process specific IP ranges.

## 🚀 Why Use IPv4 Range Expander?

Managing network ranges can be complex. Whether you're configuring firewall rules, performing security scans, or setting up subnets, having a clear list of every IP in a range is invaluable.

### Developer-Centric Features
- **Real-Time Expansion**: Results update instantly as you type your CIDR or IP.
- **Large Range Handling**: Supports large subnets with a performance-optimized display limit of 1,024 addresses.
- **One-Click Copy**: Quickly copy the entire expanded list to your clipboard for use in other tools or scripts.
- **Validation & Error Feedback**: Immediate feedback on invalid CIDR masks or malformed IP addresses.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **CIDR Support**: Handles standard CIDR notation (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).
- **Single IP Support**: Works with individual IP addresses (e.g., `10.0.0.1`).
- **Performance Optimized**: Uses efficient numeric calculations and `BigInt` to handle range logic without slowing down your browser.
- **Privacy-First**: All processing is performed locally in your browser; your IP ranges are never sent to a server.
- **Smart Warnings**: Notifies you when a range is too large to display fully, ensuring the interface remains responsive.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Enter Input**: Type an IPv4 address or CIDR block into the input field (e.g., `172.16.0.0/29`).
2. **View Results**: The tool automatically calculates the range and displays the list of IP addresses in the results area.
3. **Check Limits**: If the range contains more than 1,024 addresses, a warning will appear, and the first 1,024 IPs will be shown.
4. **Copy List**: Click the **"Copy List"** button to copy all displayed IP addresses to your clipboard.

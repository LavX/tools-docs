# Chmod Calculator

A visual and interactive tool to calculate and understand Unix/Linux file permissions using octal and symbolic notations.

## 🚀 Why Use Chmod Calculator?

Managing file permissions in Unix-like systems can be confusing. The **Chmod Calculator** simplifies this process by providing a real-time, interactive interface to convert between human-readable checkboxes, octal values, and symbolic strings.

### Developer-Centric Features
- **Interactive Switches**: Toggle Read, Write, and Execute permissions for Owner, Group, and Others.
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Update permissions via switches, octal input, or symbolic input—all fields stay in sync.
- **Command Generation**: Automatically generates the exact `chmod` command you need for your terminal.
- **Instant Feedback**: See changes immediately as you interact with the tool.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Octal & Symbolic Support**: Full support for both numeric (e.g., `755`) and string (e.g., `rwxr-xr-x`) formats.
- **Validation**: Built-in input validation ensures you only enter valid octal digits (0-7) or symbolic characters (r, w, x, -).
- **Educational**: Displays the breakdown of how octal values are calculated (Read=4, Write=2, Execute=1).
- **Privacy-Focused**: All calculations are performed locally in your browser; no data is sent to any server.

## 📖 How to Use

1.  **Access the Tool**: Navigate to the [Chmod Calculator](https://tools.lavx.hu/tools/chmod-calculator) page.
2.  **Set Permissions**:

    *   OR enter a 9-character **Symbolic** string (e.g., `rw-r--r--`).
3.  **View Results**: The tool instantly updates all other fields to match your input.
4.  **Copy Command**: Copy the generated `chmod` command from the "Example Command" field to use in your terminal.

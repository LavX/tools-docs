# Git Cheatsheet

A comprehensive, searchable reference for common Git commands and workflows, designed for quick access and developer productivity.

## 🚀 Why Use Git Cheatsheet?

Managing version control can be complex. The **Git Cheatsheet** tool provides a curated list of essential Git commands, categorized by their function, to help you navigate your development workflow with ease.

### Developer-Centric Features
- **Categorized Commands**: Commands are logically grouped into sections like Setup, Staging, Branching, Remotes, and History.
- **Real-Time Search**: Instantly filter commands and descriptions to find exactly what you need. The search matches against both the command syntax and its explanation.
- **One-Click Copy**: Quickly copy any command to your clipboard. The interface provides immediate visual feedback ("Copied!") upon success.
- **Privacy-Focused**: All searching and filtering happens entirely in your browser. No data is sent to any server.

- **Setup & Configuration**: Commands for setting up your identity and initializing repositories.
- **Staging & Committing Changes**: Essential commands for managing your staging area and recording changes.
- **Branching & Merging**: Tools for navigating branches, merging code, and rebasing, including modern alternatives like `git switch`.

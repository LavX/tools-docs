# EML Analyzer

Analyze EML files securely in your browser. Extract headers, view message bodies, manage attachments, and generate detailed forensic reports without uploading your data to any server.

## 🚀 Why Use EML Analyzer?

**EML Analyzer** is a professional-grade utility for security researchers, IT administrators, and curious users who need to inspect email files (`.eml`) safely. Unlike online services that require you to upload sensitive emails to their servers, our tool processes everything locally in your browser.

### Key Benefits
- **Privacy First**: Your email content never leaves your device. All parsing and analysis happen client-side.
- **Multi-File Support**: Upload and switch between multiple EML files for efficient batch analysis.
- **Forensic Ready**: Extract raw headers and generate PDF reports suitable for documentation or spam reporting.
- **Comprehensive View**: Access HTML/Text bodies, metadata, and attachments in one unified interface.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Secure Client-Side Parsing**: Uses high-performance libraries to parse RFC 822 messages directly in the browser.
- **Detailed Metadata Overview**: Instantly view Subject, From, To, Date, and Message-ID.
- **Rich Body Rendering**: Automatically renders HTML emails in a sandboxed environment or falls back to plain text for maximum compatibility.
- **Attachment Management**: List all attachments with MIME types and sizes, and download them individually.
- **Raw Header Analysis**: Inspect the full, unedited email headers to trace routing and identify spoofing.
- **Advanced Export Options**:
    - **PDF Reports**: Generate a comprehensive analysis report including overview, body, and headers.
    - **Header Export**: Batch export raw headers from all uploaded files into a single text file for spam reporting.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Upload Files**: Drag and drop one or more `.eml` files into the upload zone or click to select files.
2. **Select a File**: Use the sidebar to switch between different uploaded emails.
3. **Explore Tabs**:

4. **Export Results**:
    - Use **"Headers (TXT)"** to save raw headers for all files.

# CIDR Calculator

A professional-grade utility for calculating IPv4 network ranges, subnet masks, and host details using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation.

## 🚀 Why Use CIDR Calculator?

Managing IP networks requires precision. The **CIDR Calculator** provides instant, accurate calculations for network administrators and developers, eliminating manual binary math and potential configuration errors.

### Developer-Centric Features
- **Real-time Calculation**: Results update instantly as you adjust the IP or prefix.
- **Dual Input Methods**: Use the slider for quick adjustments or the numeric input for precise prefix control.
- **Binary Visualization**: View the IP, mask, and network addresses in binary format to understand the bit-level logic.
- **RFC Compliance**: Correctly handles special cases like /31 (point-to-point) and /32 (host) networks.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Comprehensive Network Details**:
    - **Network & Broadcast Addresses**: Identify the boundaries of your subnet.
    - **Subnet & Wildcard Masks**: Get both standard and inverse masks for firewall or routing configurations.
    - **Usable Host Range**: Automatically calculates the first and last assignable IP addresses.
    - **Host Counting**: Displays both total and usable host counts (accounting for network and broadcast overhead).
- **Binary Representation**: Clear breakdown of how the subnet mask segments the IP address.
- **Input Validation**: Built-in checks for valid IPv4 formats and prefix ranges (0-32).
- **Privacy-First**: All calculations are performed locally in your browser; no IP data is sent to the server.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Enter IP Address**: Type your base IPv4 address (e.g., `192.168.1.0`) into the IP Address field.
2. **Set CIDR Prefix**: Use the slider or the number input to set the prefix length (e.g., `24` for a standard Class C subnet).
3. **Analyze Results**: The tool automatically calculates and displays:
    - Network and Broadcast addresses.
    - Subnet and Wildcard masks.
    - First and last usable host addresses.
    - Total and usable host counts.
4. **Review Binary**: Scroll down to see the binary representation of your network configuration for deeper analysis.

    - <span style="color: #facc15">**Yellow (3xx)**</span>: Redirection
    - <span style="color: #fb923c">**Orange (4xx)**</span>: Client Error
    - <span style="color: #f87171">**Red (5xx)**</span>: Server Error
4. **Analyze**: Review the reason phrase and description to understand the server's response and determine the next steps in your debugging or development process.

## 📊 Status Code Classes

- **1xx (Informational)**: The request was received, continuing process.
- **2xx (Successful)**: The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
- **3xx (Redirection)**: Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request.

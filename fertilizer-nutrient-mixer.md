# Fertilizer/Plant Nutrient Mixer

A professional-grade utility designed to calculate the precise mix of fertilizers required to achieve specific nutrient targets for various plant species and growth stages.

## 🚀 Why Use Fertilizer/Plant Nutrient Mixer?

Achieving the perfect nutrient balance is critical for plant health, yield, and quality. Manual calculations for multi-component fertilizer mixes are complex and prone to error. The **Fertilizer/Plant Nutrient Mixer** automates this process using advanced mathematical models, ensuring your plants get exactly what they need.

### Precision & Scientific Accuracy
- **Advanced Linear Algebra Engine**: Utilizes matrix inversion for exact solutions, least-norm for underdetermined systems, and least-squares optimization for overdetermined scenarios.
- **Non-Negative Constraint Solver**: Employs iterative optimization to ensure all calculated fertilizer amounts are physically possible (non-negative), even when an exact mathematical match is unavailable.
- **Multi-Nutrient Support**: Simultaneously calculates targets for Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), and Sulfur (S).
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides a reliability metric (0.0 to 1.0) based on mathematical residuals, indicating how closely the calculated mix matches your target profile.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Extensive Preset Library**: Access a comprehensive database of common fertilizers (organic and synthetic) and scientifically-backed nutrient profiles for various crops and growth stages.
- **Custom Fertilizer Profiles**: Input your own fertilizer sources by specifying their N-P-K-Ca-Mg-S percentage concentrations.
- **Optimal Combination Finder**: Automatically analyzes the preset library to find the most effective combination of 2, 3, or 4 fertilizers to meet your specific nutrient targets.
- **Mixing Visualizer**: Interactive breakdown showing the exact weight of each component and the resulting nutrient profile compared to your targets.
- **Privacy-First**: All calculations are performed locally in your browser; your proprietary mixing data never leaves your device.

## 📖 How to Use

1.  **Define Fertilizer Sources**: Add the fertilizers you have available. You can select from presets or enter custom values from your fertilizer labels.
2.  **Set Target Nutrients**: Specify the desired nutrient levels (as percentages). You can use presets for specific plants and growth stages.
3.  **Specify Total Amount**: Enter the total weight of the final fertilizer mix you wish to create (e.g., in grams).
4.  **Calculate**: Click **"Calculate Mix"** to run the optimization engine.
5.  **Find Optimal (Optional)**: Use the **"Find Optimal Fertilizers"** feature to let the tool suggest the best combination from the preset library.
6.  **Review Results**: View the required amount for each fertilizer source, the resulting nutrient profile, and the confidence score of the mix.

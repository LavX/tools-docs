# Gas Fee Estimator

Estimate transaction fees across multiple blockchain networks using simulated network data and customizable parameters.

## 🚀 Why Use Gas Fee Estimator?

**Gas Fee Estimator** provides a comprehensive view of potential network costs, helping you understand and plan your blockchain transactions. Whether you're sending ETH, swapping tokens, or minting NFTs, this tool helps you visualize how different priority levels affect transaction costs across various ecosystems.

### Key Benefits
- **Multi-Network Simulation**: Compare estimated fees across **Ethereum**, **Polygon**, **Arbitrum**, **Optimism**, and **Base**.
- **Transaction Presets**: Quickly calculate costs for common actions like ETH transfers, ERC-20 swaps, and NFT mints using standard gas limits.
- **Fiat Conversion**: View estimates in both native tokens and fiat currencies (**USD/EUR**) based on simulated market rates.
- **Priority Levels**: Get clear cost breakdowns for **Low**, **Medium**, and **High** priority transactions.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Gas Price Breakdown**: Displays simulated gas prices in Gwei, including base fees for various networks.
- **Custom Gas Limits**: Manually adjust gas limits (minimum 21,000) to simulate complex smart contract interactions.
- **Transaction Presets**:
  - **ETH Transfer**: 21,000 gas
  - **ERC-20 Transfer**: 65,000 gas
  - **Swap on DEX**: 180,000 gas
  - **NFT Mint**: 150,000 gas
  - **NFT Transfer**: 80,000 gas
  - **Contract Deployment**: 800,000 gas
- **Trend Visualization**: View a simulated 7-day gas price trend to understand typical network fluctuations.
- **Educational Insights**: Learn about gas limits, gas prices, and network-specific fee structures through integrated guides.
- **Privacy-Focused**: All calculations are performed locally in your browser; no transaction data is sent to any server.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Select Network**: Choose the blockchain network you want to simulate fees for (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, or Base).
2. **Choose Transaction Type**: Select a preset (like "ETH Transfer" or "Swap on DEX") or choose "Custom" to enter a specific gas limit.
3. **Set Custom Limit**: If "Custom" is selected, enter the desired gas limit (minimum 21,000).
4. **Toggle Currency**: Switch between **USD** and **EUR** to see fiat estimates based on simulated market prices.
5. **Analyze Results**: Review the Low, Medium, and High priority estimates to understand the cost implications of different network conditions.

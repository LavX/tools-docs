# Cyber Pipeline

Chain multiple data transformations visually with a sequential workflow builder. Cyber Pipeline allows you to process text through a series of encoders, decoders, and formatters in real-time.

## 🚀 Why Use Cyber Pipeline?

**Cyber Pipeline** is a powerful utility for developers, security researchers, and data analysts who need to perform multi-step data manipulations without writing scripts. Instead of manually copying and pasting between different tools, you can build a custom processing chain.

### Key Benefits
- **Visual Workflow**: See exactly how your data changes at each step of the pipeline.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Results update instantly as you type or modify the pipeline.
- **Privacy-First**: All transformations happen locally in your browser; your data never leaves your machine.
- **Zero Setup**: No installation or configuration required.

## 🛠️ Supported Operations

Cyber Pipeline features a wide range of operations across several categories:

### 🔐 Encoding & Decoding
- **Base64**: Convert text to and from Base64 encoding.
- **URL**: Encode or decode special characters for use in URLs.
- **HTML**: Escape or unescape HTML entities (e.g., `&` to `&`).
- **Hex**: Convert text to its hexadecimal representation and back.

### 📝 Text Manipulation
- **Case Conversion**: Quickly switch between Uppercase and Lowercase.
- **Reverse**: Flip the entire string backwards.
- **ROT13**: Apply or remove the ROT13 substitution cipher.

### 📋 Formatting
- **JSON Pretty Print**: Format minified or messy JSON into a readable, indented structure.
- **Hex Dump**: Generate a formatted hex dump of your input data.

### 🔢 Hashing (Preview)
- Support for **MD5**, **SHA1**, and **SHA256** (currently provides placeholders for integration).

# ETA Calculator

Estimate the time remaining and completion date/time for any task based on its total size, current progress, and processing speed.

## 🚀 Why Use ETA Calculator?

Whether you're tracking a file download, a data migration, or a long-running computational task, the **ETA Calculator** provides instant, accurate projections. It eliminates the need for manual time-to-completion formulas and provides a clear, human-readable breakdown of when your task will finish.

### Precision & Clarity
- **Real-Time Projections**: Automatically updates results as you adjust your inputs.
- **Human-Readable Format**: Converts raw seconds into a clear breakdown of days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Localized Completion Time**: Provides the exact date and time of completion based on your local timezone.
- **Flexible Units**: Works with any unit of measurement—items, megabytes, records, or custom tasks.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Dynamic Calculation**: Instant feedback as you type, with no need to click a "Calculate" button.
- **Validation Checks**: Built-in logic ensures inputs are logical (e.g., completed work cannot exceed total work).
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Quickly copy the remaining time or the final ETA date for use in reports or status updates.
- **Privacy-First**: All calculations are performed locally in your browser; your task data never leaves your device.

## 📖 How to Use

1.  **Total Work**: Enter the total size or quantity of the task (e.g., `1000` items or `500` MB).
2.  **Completed Work**: Enter the amount already finished (e.g., `250`).
3.  **Speed**: Enter the current processing rate in units per second (e.g., `10` units/sec).
4.  **Unit of Work**: (Optional) Label your work units (e.g., `tasks`, `files`, `GB`) for clearer results.

# CSS Unit Converter

A precise and flexible utility for converting between various CSS units, including absolute, relative, and physical measurements.

## 🚀 Why Use CSS Unit Converter?

Modern web development requires working with a variety of units to ensure responsive and accessible designs. The **CSS Unit Converter** simplifies this process by providing real-time conversions with full control over contextual variables like font sizes and viewport dimensions.

### Developer-Centric Features
- **Real-Time Conversion**: Results update instantly as you type or change units.
- **Context-Aware**: Handles relative units (`em`, `rem`, `%`) and viewport units (`vw`, `vh`) by allowing you to specify the reference values.
- **Physical Unit Support**: Convert to and from `cm`, `mm`, `in`, and `pt` using standard screen DPI (96).
- **Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects your current viewport dimensions for immediate use.

## 🛠️ Supported Units

- **Absolute**: Pixels (`px`)
- **Relative to Font**: `em`, `rem`
- **Relative to Viewport**: Viewport Width (`vw`), Viewport Height (`vh`)
- **Percentage**: `%` (calculated relative to parent font size)
- **Physical**: Inches (`in`), Centimeters (`cm`), Millimeters (`mm`), Points (`pt`)

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Enter Value**: Type the numeric value you wish to convert in the **Value** field.
2. **Select Units**: Choose your source unit (**From Unit**) and target unit (**To Unit**).
3. **Configure Context**: If using relative units, adjust the contextual values:
    - **Root Font Size**: Set the base font size for `rem` conversions (default is 16px).
    - **Parent Font Size**: Set the reference font size for `em` and `%` conversions.
    - **Viewport Dimensions**: Override the auto-detected width and height for `vw` and `vh` calculations.
4. **View Results**: The converted value appears instantly at the bottom of the tool.

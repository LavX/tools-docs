# Image Converter

A professional, browser-based utility for converting images between various formats with batch processing support, quality optimization, and a privacy-first approach.

## 🚀 Why Use Image Converter?

**Image Converter** is built for speed, security, and efficiency. Unlike traditional online converters that upload your files to a server, this tool performs all operations locally within your browser using the `browser-image-compression` library. This ensures your sensitive data never leaves your device while providing a seamless, high-performance experience.

### Key Benefits
- **Privacy-First Architecture**: All image processing occurs entirely in your browser. No data is ever uploaded to our servers.
- **Batch Processing**: Upload and convert multiple images simultaneously to save time.
- **Quality Optimization**: Fine-tune the balance between file size and visual fidelity for lossy formats.
- **Instant Feedback**: Real-time status updates and size comparison (savings/increase) for every file.
- **Zero Cost & No Limits**: Professional-grade conversion without subscriptions, watermarks, or file size restrictions.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on any modern web browser across desktop and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Comprehensive Format Support**:
  - **Input**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP, GIF, BMP.
  - **Output**: PNG, JPG, WEBP, GIF.
- **Granular Quality Control**: Adjust the compression level (5% to 100%) for JPG and WEBP outputs to optimize for web performance or print quality.
- **Smart Previews**: View original images and converted results instantly before downloading.
- **Detailed Analytics**: Each conversion displays original vs. converted file sizes and the exact percentage of space saved or increased.
- **Efficient Batch Actions**:
  - **Convert All**: Process your entire queue with a single click.
  - **Staggered Download**: Automatically downloads all converted files with a slight delay (200ms) between each to prevent browser blocking.
  - **Clear All**: Quickly reset your workspace and free up browser memory.
- **Memory Management**: Automatically cleans up temporary browser resources (Object URLs) to maintain system performance.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Upload Images**: Drag and drop your files or click the upload area to select images (PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP, GIF, BMP).
2. **Configure Output**:
   - Select your target format (PNG, JPG, WEBP, or GIF).
   - If using JPG or WEBP, adjust the **Quality** slider. 100% provides maximum fidelity, while lower values (down to 5%) significantly reduce file size.
3. **Convert**: Click **"Convert Image(s)"**. You can monitor the progress and status of each file in the results section.
4. **Review Results**: Check the file size comparison to ensure the output meets your requirements.
5. **Download**: Click **"Download Images"** to save all successfully converted files to your device.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Note on GIF Conversion**: This tool is optimized for static image conversion. Converting to GIF format may result in a static image or only the first frame. True animated GIF preservation is not supported by the current browser-based engine.

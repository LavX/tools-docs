# Payload Vending Machine

Interactive cheatsheet for pentesters. Copy common SQLi, XSS, RCE, LFI, SSTI, XXE, and other payloads with a single click.

## 🚀 Why Use Payload Vending Machine?

The **Payload Vending Machine** provides a comprehensive collection of security testing payloads for cybersecurity professionals, penetration testers, and security researchers. Whether you're performing security audits, bug bounty hunting, or learning about web application vulnerabilities, this tool offers organized, categorized payloads for efficient testing.

### Security First
- **Client-Side Processing**: All operations run locally in your browser. No data is sent to external servers.
- **No Data Logging**: We don't store your inputs, search queries, or copied payloads. Your testing activity remains private.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Comprehensive Collection**: 60+ pre-built payloads covering multiple vulnerability categories
- **Intelligent Search**: Search by payload title, content, or description with instant results
- **Category Filtering**: Filter payloads by vulnerability type (SQLi, XSS, RCE, LFI, SSTI, XXE, Misc)
- **One-Click Copy**: Copy any payload to clipboard with a single click
- **Visual Categories**: Color-coded categories with intuitive icons for quick identification
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## 📋 Available Payload Categories

### SQL Injection (SQLi)
Authentication bypasses, UNION-based queries, blind injection, time-based delays, error-based exploits, and polyglot payloads for MySQL, MSSQL, and PostgreSQL.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 
Basic alert payloads, image onerror handlers, SVG exploits, XSS polyglots, Angular/Vue template injections, and protocol handlers.

### Remote Code Execution (RCE)
Unix command injection, Windows RCE, reverse shells, blind command execution, and various command separators.

### Local File Inclusion (LFI)
Directory traversal paths, null byte bypasses, double-encoding, Windows targets, and PHP wrapper exploits.

### Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
Jinja2, Twig, and Java Spring template injection payloads for various frameworks.
